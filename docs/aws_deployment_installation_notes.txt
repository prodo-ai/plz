cd plz

Create a directory to store your secrets
mkdir -p secrets/keys

Create a key with
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C 'youemail@mailserver.com' -f secrets/keys/id_rsa -N ''
This is used when creating the AMIs

Install terraform

Install packer

Install ansible
pip install ansible --user

Install basic auxiliary tools
sudo apt install zsh jq

Configure your aws settings:
cp example.config.json secrets/config.json
and edit the file accordingly

If you want to make your own amis. Set the ami_tag in secrets/config.json, then
SECRETS_DIR=$PWD/secrets make -C machines/ml amis

Create the machine and associated resources (security groups, etc.)
SECRETS_DIR=$PWD/secrets make -C machines/ml deploy
Make a note of the line
controller-host-public-ip = XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX

Deploy the controller image
SECRETS_DIR=$PWD/secrets make deploy

ssh -i secrets/keys/id_rsa  ubuntu@PUBLIC_IP
# Where PUBLIC_IP is the one you made a note of after creating the machine
sudo su -
cd /cache/plz-user-home
mkdir .ssh
vi authorized_keys
[Paste the contents of secrets/keys/id_rsa.pub]

In your plz.config.json you will need to add:

    "connection_info": {
      "username": "plz-user",
      "path_to_private_key": "<absolute_to_your_secrets>/secrets/keys/id_rsa",
      "schema": "http-ssh"
    }

and change "host" to be the public ip of the controller.

If you don't use the server continuously, you can stop it from the AWS
console, then restart it and do "make deploy" again. Or you can terminate it,
then restart it with
SECRETS_DIR=$PWD/secrets make -C machines/ml deploy
make a note of the IP, then
SECRETS_DIR=$PWD/secrets make deploy
All of your plz data is stored in a non-ephemeral volume that is re-attached to
the machine created
